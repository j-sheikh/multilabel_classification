In this project we had to analyse and clean a messy data set of ordered sensor measurements, which were collected over time. Since our final goal was to predict the target variable for unseen data, we can categorize this machine learning task as supervised learning, regression. The used model is Linear Regression. R2 and MSE were chosen as evaluation metrics as well as cross validation for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore different data cleaning and preproccessing steps had to be conducted.
