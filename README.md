In this project we had to classify given red, green and blue images, with the use of various machine learning algorithms, to their corresponding labels. Since images can have multiple labels we can categorize this machine learning task as supervised learning, multi-label classification. The used models are Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Multi-label K-Nearest neighbor (ML-kNN) as well as Logistic Regression (LogReg) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) with the use of MultiOutputClassifer (MOC). The F-score was chosen as an evaluation metric. Furthermore different preproccessing techniques as well as cross validation for model selection and hyperparameter tuning has been used.
